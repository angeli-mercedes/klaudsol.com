                        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy describes how personal information is collected, used, and shared when you install or use any of the Apps developed by KlaudSol
in connection with your Shopify-supported store.
</p>

<h3>
  Personal Information the App Collects
</h3>

<p>
When you install any of our Apps, we are automatically able to access certain types of information from your Shopify account: 
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>domain</strong> and <strong>*.myshopify domain</strong> of your online store.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
We collect personal information directly from the relevant individual, or through your Shopify account.
</p>

<h3>
How Do We Use Your Personal Information?
</h3>

<p>
We use the personal information we collect from you and your customers in order to provide the Service and to operate the App. 
</p>

<h3>
Sharing Your Personal Information
</h3>

<p>
By default, we never share your personal information to any third-parties outside KlaudSol Philippines, Inc.

However, we may share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.
</p>

<p>
If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. 
If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us through the contact information below.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, if you are a European resident we note that we are processing your information in order to fulfill contracts we might have with you 
(for example if you make an order through the Site), or otherwise to pursue our legitimate business interests listed above. 
Additionally, please note that your information will be transferred outside of Europe, including to Canada and the United States.
</p>


<h3>Data Retention</h3> 

<p>
When you install the App, we will maintain your data unless and until you uninstall the App and/or ask us to delete this information. Note that removing such data will render the App unusable.
</p>

<h3>Changes</h3> 

<p>
We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.
</p>
